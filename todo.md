# TODO.md — Deliverables for Medium Clone (solo dev)

> Quick rules
>
> - Create one issue per top-level checkbox.
> - Use `feature/<short-name>` branches.
> - Keep commits small and atomic.
> - Stick to the MVP first — anything marked **P2** is post-MVP.

## Optional / Post-MVP (P2)

These are valuable but delay MVP. Triage them after core shipping.

- [x] Social login (Google)

## Example acceptance checklist for a big feature (Article publish — copy into the issue)

**Article publish — Acceptance**

- [ ] Author can open editor and create an article.
- [ ] Draft is autosaved every X seconds or when user clicks save.
- [ ] Author clicks Publish → backend sets `is_published=true` and `published_at`.
- [ ] Slug is generated and unique; frontend redirects to `/articles/:slug`.
- [ ] Article page shows title, author, date, body, tags, and comments section.
- [ ] Non-authenticated users can read published articles.
- [ ] Published article appears in the home feed and is paginated correctly.

---

## Estimates (very rough)

Useful for solo planning. Adjust to your speed.

- Repo + planning docs: 4–8 hours
- Auth + DB migrations: 8–16 hours
- Article API + backend CRUD: 12–24 hours
- Editor + autosave: 8–20 hours (depends on editor choice)
- Frontend pages (feed, article, profile): 12–28 hours
- Integration & deploy: 6–12 hours
- Polish & accessibility: 6–12 hours

---

## Final note (encouragement)

Ship the smallest happy path first: **signup → write → publish → view**. That one loop proves the product exists and unlocks everything else. Keep checkboxes small, push often, and don’t polish UI until the loop works.
